script to calculate a universal Goodness-of-Fit value for rhythm analysis

I present here the script to calculate the newly developed universal goodness-of-fit value. 
It can be used to calculate how well a rhythm in terms of beats per second (Hertz) fits an onset series of for example 
acoustic signals in animal communication. It can be used for all methods out there to calculate rhythms, which are descriped for example 
in Burchardt & Knörnschild (2020) or Ravignani & Norton (2017).
